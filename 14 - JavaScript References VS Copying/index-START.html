    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2); 
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2); 
    /* everythings normal */
     

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Lux";
    /*players will change because variable team is just a reference to the orig array players */


    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); 
    /* passing an empty argument at slice will just give you the array */

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread webos favorite
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99,age: 12 });
    /*Object.assign( empty array, array to be copied, elements to be added )*/
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; 

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    //danger, it copies only 1 level deep. nested object wil affect the original 
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    //poor Mans cloneDeep
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
